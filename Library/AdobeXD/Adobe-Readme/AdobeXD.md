### üìåNew Features in Adobe XD 40.0

The May 2021 release of XD has the following features:

- Live cursors take coediting to the next level
- Share selected artboards quickly without wiring them
- Create shortcut for toggle state
- Customize your in-app experience using Preferences

#### ‚≠êLive Cursors take coediting to the next level

You can see where your coeditors are working in a shared document with the help of remote live cursors. Select View > Show/Hide Live Cursors to enable or disable Live Cursors. By default, Show Live Cursors is enabled.

`3D transforms at work`

#### ‚≠êReusable design systems with Creative Cloud Libraries

With XD, creating and maintaining a design system is flexible, frictionless, and intuitive. You can use design systems to create and publish Creative Cloud Libraries from cloud documents to share your reusable design system elements with your team, allowing them to design consistently across their design projects.

`Design systems with CC libraries`

#### ‚≠êRobust collaboration with coediting

Coediting is no longer a beta feature and is up for general use. You can now click on avatars and jump to the location where your collaborators are working on the canvas and edit them in real time!

`Real-time collaboration with coediting`

#### ‚≠êBuild cohesive designs with Creative Cloud Libraries

With the all new Creative Cloud Libraries integration, you can centrally manage and distribute design and brand systems assets at scale.
Start by curating your sticker sheet with set of components and styles that constitute design and brand system in an XD cloud document; when ready to share those reusable assets with your broader team, you can publish your sticker sheet cloud document as a library and invite your teams, with the right set of permissions.

`CC libraries integration within XD`

#### ‚≠êDesign flexible text layouts with auto-height text

Ease your work by using auto height text that dynamically adjusts the height based on the content of the text object while its width remains fixed!

`Text layouts with auto height`

#### ‚≠êFlexible designing with nested components

With nested component workflows, work with complex components that contain other components within them with ease! Modify instances of a component nested within another component without impacting the main component and watch your designs come alive!

<img src="/Library/AdobeXD/Adobe-Assets/Adobe16.gif">

`Nested component workflows`

#### ‚≠êImproved developer handoff with component states in design specs

Developers can contextually view, inspect, and download assets for all the states of a component. No more listing of component states in separate artboards!

<img src="/Library/AdobeXD/Adobe-Assets/Adobe17.png">

#### ‚≠êEnhanced efficiency of sharing components with multiple states

You can now create components with multiple states like hover, pressed, enabled, and more as part of a design system and publish them to a Creative Cloud library.
